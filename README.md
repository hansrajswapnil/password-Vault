# password-Vault
We are implementing a Secure Password Vault which will store the username and passwords for diffrent applications we use. 
We have also a password rotation policy to secure itself from any security breaches.

This project is implemented using Flask framework in Python. Diffrent forms for pages like login and register are created using flask forms. For basic styling, Bootstrap and JS are used. We are using SQLAlchemy which is provided by Flask itself for creating a database which allows to access SQL in an object oriented way.
